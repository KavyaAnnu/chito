description: Chito-Armor is a biodegradable, chitosan-based paste used as a targeted drug delivery system to minimize and eliminate infections. Owing to its anti-microbial property, our studies proved it to be useful by itself or along with other FDA approved antibiotic drugs. Our product will be utilized by trauma centers, orthopedic surgeons, primary care physicians, urgent cares and pharmacies. Based on successful results from pre-clinical studies, an invention disclosure has already been created with the office of tech transfer at University of Memphis.
