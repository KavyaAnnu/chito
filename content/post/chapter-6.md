Chito-Armor is a biodegradable, chitosan-based paste used as a targeted drug delivery system to minimize
and eliminate infections. Owing to its anti-microbial property, our studies proved it to be useful by itself or
along with other FDA approved antibiotic drugs. Our product will be utilized by trauma centers, orthopedic
surgeons, primary care physicians, urgent cares and pharmacies. Based on successful results from
pre-clinical studies, an invention disclosure has already been created with the office of tech transfer
at University of Memphis. Currently, we are in-progress with second stage of preclinical studies.
